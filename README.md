## Project Overview

This project analyzes medical insurance data to identify key drivers of healthcare costs using Microsoft Excel.
The analysis focuses on demographic factors (age, gender), lifestyle risks (BMI, smoking), dependents, and regional variations to uncover actionable insights. An interactive Excel dashboard summarizes trends for quick business decision-making.

## Business Questions Addressed

Which factors have the highest impact on medical charges?

How does smoking influence healthcare costs across regions?

Is BMI a strong predictor of medical expenses?

Do dependents significantly affect insurance charges?

Which region incurs the highest medical costs?

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following variables:

Age

Gender

BMI

Smoking Status

Number of Dependents

Region

Medical Charges

Medical charges show high variability, with a strong right-skew caused by a small number of high-cost cases.

## Key Takeaways

Smoking is the strongest cost driver, with smokers incurring significantly higher medical charges across all regions.

BMI shows a weak positive correlation with charges (correlation ≈ 0.19), indicating limited predictive power alone.

Southeast region records the highest average medical charges and BMI.

Dependents have no strong relationship with medical costs; high expenses appear across all family sizes.

Over 70% of individuals fall into Overweight or Obese BMI categories, highlighting a major public health concern.

## Statistical Summary

Age & BMI: Mean and median values are closely aligned, indicating stable distributions.

Medical Charges: Large gap between mean and median shows presence of high-cost outliers.

Cost Distribution: Highly right-skewed; majority fall into lower cost brackets, with very few extreme cases.

## Smoking Impact Analysis

Smokers incur multiple times higher average charges than non-smokers.

This trend remains consistent across all regions.

Smoking outweighs demographic and geographic factors in predicting high medical costs.

Insight: Lifestyle choices significantly impact healthcare expenditure.

## BMI & Cost Relationship

Correlation coefficient: ~0.198

R²: ~0.04

Medical charges increase by approx. ₹394 per BMI unit, but BMI alone explains very little variance.

Conclusion: BMI contributes to costs, but smoking and age are more influential.

## Dependents Analysis

High medical charges (₹50,000–₹60,000+) occur even with 0–2 dependents.

Larger families (4–5 dependents) generally show lower maximum charges.

No strong linear relationship between dependents and medical expenses.

## Regional Insights

Southeast region:

Highest average BMI

Highest medical charges

Other regions (Northeast, Northwest, Southwest) show similar and moderate cost levels.

Regional variation affects charges more than BMI.

## Dashboard Overview

The Excel dashboard provides:

Filters by Gender, Smoking Status, Region, BMI Category

KPI-level insights on:

Average medical charges

BMI distribution

Smoking vs non-smoking cost gaps

Visual summaries for executive-level decision-making
